**C++** is a general-purpose programming language created by **Bjarne** Stroustrup as an extension of the **C programming** language, or "C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia).
The goal of these **modules** is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.

This will be the starting point of your **C++** journey. Many languages are recommendedto learn **OOP**.

We decided to choose C++ since itâ€™s derived from our old friend C.

Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will

comply with the **C++98** standard.
